Bash Profile for your Mac
=======

## Setup
This assumes that you've installed git from XCode Command Line Tools. If not, please use [brew to install git and git completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion/wiki/Install-Bash-git-completion), and skip the step about updating the bash_profile, this should detect which install and behave appropriately.
1. Clone this repo to your `~/`
1. Append the content of `.bash_profile.sample` to the top of your existing `~\.bash_profile`
